---  
  
If ye gae up to yon hill-tap,  
Ye'll there see bonie Peggy;  
She kens her father is a laird,  
And she forsooth's a leddy.  
  
There Sophy tight, a lassie bright,  
Besides a handsome fortune:  
Wha canna win her in a night,  
Has little art in courtin'.  
  
Gae down by Faile, and taste the ale,  
And tak a look o' Mysie;  
She's dour and din, a deil within,  
But aiblins she may please ye.  
  
If she be shy, her sister try,  
Ye'll maybe fancy Jenny;  
If ye'll dispense wi' want o' sense--  
She kens hersel she's bonie.  
  
As ye gae up by yon hillside,  
Speir in for bonie Bessy;  
She'll gie ye a beck, and bid ye light,  
And handsomely address ye.  
  
There's few sae bonie, nane sae guid,  
In a' King George' dominion;  
If ye should doubt the truth o' this--  
It's Bessy's ain opinion!
